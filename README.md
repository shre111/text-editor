## Implementation Details

### Technical Stack
- React (v19)
- Tiptap Editor
- Vite (for build and development)

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Component Structure**
   - Separate TiptapEditor component for reusability
   - Clean separation of styling and logic

2. **State Management**
   - Used React's useState for local state management
   - Implemented content persistence using localStorage
   - Real-time HTML preview updates

3. **Styling Approach**
   - Modular CSS for component-specific styles
   - Glass-morphism design for modern UI
   - Responsive layout using calc() for width calculations

### Trade-offs and Decisions

1. **Storage Solution**
   - Used localStorage for simplicity
   - Trade-off: Limited storage space but no backend required
   - Can be easily extended to use backend storage

2. **Custom Extension**
   - Implemented Callout block for demonstration
   - Trade-off: Kept it simple for clarity vs. adding more complex features

3. **UI/UX Decisions**
   - Glass-morphism design for modern look
   - Floating toolbar for better accessibility
   - Real-time HTML preview for immediate feedback
